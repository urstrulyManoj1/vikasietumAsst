Vikasietum Pizza Assignment
A new startup company approached you to develop a pizza ordering service “PizzaFactory”
to manage their pizza orders. A simple UI client is deployed on self-service terminals where
customers can enter their orders by selecting various options. The self-service terminal client
receives the menu and other information from the “PizzaFactory” service and also forwards all
order creation requests to the same service.
The PizzaFactory backend service keeps a tab on existing inventory of the required ingredients
and forwards received orders to backend systems. You are supposed to come up with a data
model and create a basic service using plain java classes that serve as a proof of concept for the
pizza ordering service.
`
The Goal
Your application needs to showcase your talent for conceptualizing a problem and formulating 
a solution while adhering to good programming practices and principles.
Please note:
1. No UI Client needs to be implemented.
2. Basic service should be implemented using plain java classes and simple in memory 
data
store (Collections).
3. Important unit tests to validate business requirements should be implemented.
Requirements:
• The service will be accepting requests from multiple self-service terminals.
• Customers can select one or more Pizzas from the menu and then customize them 
with
available options.
• Customers should be able to select a type of crust and add extra toppings.
• Customers should be able to verify their order, check the amount and place the order 
Once
the order is received service will verify the business rules and confirm the order. 
Payment
/order processing workflow is intentionally skipped here to keep it simple.
• Customers can also place side orders along with the pizza order.
• The “PizzaFactory” ensures that appropriate inventory is available before allowing
customers to proceed with their orders. It also makes best efforts to utilize inventory in 
an
optimal manner to fulfill maximum orders.
• Customers can’t cancel the order once it is placed.
• The vendor can restock inventory through “PizzaFactory” service.
• The vendor should be able to add new pizzas, toppings, sides and also change prices.
The design should require minimal changes in the code while adding new business 
rules.
